# SVM
End-to-End SVM Platform

This project is a Streamlit-based web application that demonstrates a complete machine learning pipeline using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier.

The app allows users to:

Upload or download a dataset

Perform basic exploratory data analysis (EDA)

Clean data by handling missing values

Save and reload cleaned datasets

Train an SVM model with configurable parameters

Evaluate the model using accuracy and a confusion matrix

The goal of this project is to show how an end-to-end ML workflow can be built and executed interactively without writing extra code.

Technologies used: Streamlit, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn.
